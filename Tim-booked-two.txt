# Limerick

A priest and a shepherd from Australia participate in a TV game. After answering all the questions, there is a tie.
So both are given one final assignment. It is to write a poem in three minutes, using the word "Timbuktu".
It is a city in Africa.

The priest returns with the fruit of his inspiration:

"I was a father all my life,
I had no children, had no wife,
I read the bible through and through 
on my way to Timbuktu ... "

The poem makes a great impression, and the priest smells a sweet victory. But then comes the shepherd,
with his winning masterpiece:

When Tim and I to Brisbane went
we met three ladies in a tent
as they were three and we were two
so I booked one and Tim booked two.
